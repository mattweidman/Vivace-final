# Vivace

Vivace is a cloud service for distributing and managing sheet music for bands.

We have gathered code from the different parts of our project and put it in one repository. There are several sub-directories containing code from different parts:
* mobile-app: PhoneGap mobile app
* python: Python scripts for testing and the desktop app
* tier-1: ASP.NET web application hosted on Azure
* uploading-website: small localhost website for uploading songs and parts

Each sub-directory has its own README file for more information.
