# Vivace Python scripts

This folder contains Python scripts we have used in our project.

File app.py is the program users run on their computer to implement tracking. It contains a UI for updating the measure number and can host a server if you enter an event ID.

File Desktop_Stress_Test.py contains code we used for stress-testing the tracker. It simulates 50 clients requesting measure and tempo from app.py.
